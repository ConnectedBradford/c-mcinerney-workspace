    "### Hit rates of our caseness variable\n",
    "The two hit rates of the caseness variable refers to the classification accuracy values of classifying everyone as either having or not having complex mental health difficulties. For example, if 20% of our cohort were defined as having a record of complex mental health difficulties, then the hit rate (a.k.a. classification accuracy) for assuming everyone has complex mental health difficulties would be 20%. Conversely, the hit rate for assuming no one has complex mental health difficulties would be 80%. The better performing of these two assumptions is the simplest and best-yet rule we have for identifying complex mental health difficulties. We do this to illustrate the benchmark hit rate that we are trying to beat with our sets of indicative features, which should improve out classification accuracy to make up for complicating our classification rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Entropy of our caseness variable\n",
    "The entropy of our caseness variable is a measure of how uncertain we can be about a given patient's value. If the entropy is low, it tells us that most patients either have complex mental health difficulties or most patients do not have complex mental health difficulties. Either way, we learn from the entropy value that going through the effort of finding indicative features isn’t going to be much more of a help than classifying unclassified patients using the benchmark hit rate. If this is the case, perhaps a better use of our time would be to focus our research on defining CMHD so that it distinguishes our sample of patients better.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the entropy value is high - though it is theoretically bounded by $log_{base}2$ where $base$ is the logarithmic base of our choosing - it tells us that we have a non-trivial mix of patients with and without complex mental health difficulties, in our sample. We would learn that we are justified in wanting to reduce the uncertainty (a.k.a. _surprisal_) inherent in our definition of complex mental health difficulties. Given that our caseness variable has only two possible values, the highest entropy we can expect is akin to knowing the outcome of a coin toss. We can calculate a scaled entropy - 0 to 1, or 0% to 100% - that tells us how close to the coin-toss scenario we would be if we were asked to identify whether a patient has complex mental health difficulties, but without any further information to help.\n",

Our intention to reduce this uncertainty by leveraging information from other sources seems like it will be worthwhile. Given this encourgement to continue, the second point defines a benchmark for the indicative performance of any feature set that we evalaute in our study. Specifically, any feature set that we suggest to improve our certainty of knowing that someone has complex mental health difficulties must correctly identify >86.3% of patients in our sample. Otherwise, the added feature set is a needless complication to our attempt to know whether someone has complex mental health difficulties."
