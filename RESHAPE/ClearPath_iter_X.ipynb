    "All process models will be evaluated for the control, engagement, and adherence statistics listed below. All adherence statistics will be calculated by the `AdhereR` package in R. \"CMA\" stands for continuous medication adherence. \"Duration of supply\" is the quantity of medication prescribed divided by the directed daily usage (e.g. 28 tablets at 1 per day = 28-day duration of supply). These durations can overlap. Although arithmetically equivalent, the \"duration of theoretical adherence\" assumes the durations of supply are stitched end-to-end rather than overlapped.\n",

    "2. _Test improvement_: a binary indicator variable indicating whether the given test value is an 'Improvment' or 'Disimprovement' relative to the previous test value.\n",
    "#### Engagement statistics\n",

    "4. _CMA1_ a.k.a. _Medication Possession Ratio_ a.k.a. _Compliance Rate_: the sum of every prescription's duration of supply from all but the last prescription started within the observations window, divided by the number of days between the first and last prescription.\n",
    "5. _CMA2_ a.k.a. _Medication Possession Ratio_ a.k.a. _Continuous Measure of Medication Acquisition_: the sum of every prescription's duration of supply from all prescriptions started within the observations window, divided by the number of days between the first prescription and the end of the observation window. \n",
    "6. _CMA3_ a.k.a. _Proportion of Days Covered_: CMA1 capped at 1.0.\n",

    "10. _CAM7_: the sum of every prescription's duration of theoretical adherence from all prescriptions started within the observations window, plus any portion of the duration of theoretical adherence from prescriptions started before the observation window, all divided by the width of the observation window.\n",
    "11. _CAM8_: the sum of every prescription's duration of theoretical adherence from all prescriptions started within the observations window, divided by the width of the observation window, but the start of the observation window is lagged to start on the date that the duration of theoretical adherence from prescriptions started before the observation window ends.\n",
    "12. _CAM9_: the numerator is the sum of either a) all durations of theoretical adherence, if there is overlap, or b) each duration of supply as a proportion of inter-prescription days. The denominator is the width of the observation window. Essentially, if gaps exist between prescriptions, it assumes they don't by spreading the supply over the inter-prescription period, which results in fractional daily supply (rather than the true case of full supply on some days and no supply on others). Finaly prescriptions are included.\n",
    "\n",
    "All adherence statistics can be calculated by the `AdhereR` package in R. \"CMA\" stands for continuous medication adherence. Other key concepts related to the adherence statistics are:\n",
    "- the follow-up window is the total period for which relevant prescriptions are included.\n",
    "- the observation window is the period within the follow-up window for which adherence is calculated. This is always expected to occur after the last prescription of interest.\n",
    "- the date of prescription is used as the date of dispense or issue when the date of dispense or issue are not available.\n",
    "- surplus medication from earlier overlapping events within the observation are carried over, for CAM5 and higher.\n",
    "- surplus medication from before the observation are carried over, for CAM7 and higher.\n",
    "- CAM3 will always equal CAM5, and CAM4 will always equal CAM6 for a fixed observation window\n",
    "- it is possible to set threshold gaps between prescriptions that do break the prescription history into epsiodes within the observation window. The CMAs can be calculated for these periods instead of considering the entire observation window as one episode.\n",
    "- if the period between prescriptions is greater than the N-per-day expection, then one can assume that either a) patients use the medication sparingly and get a new prescription exactly when their previous prescription is exhausted, or b) the period between prescriptions are made up of a period of perfect dherence to the N-per-day expectation followed by a period with no medicatl available. The distinction between these distinguishes CMAs 1-4 from CMAs 5-9."
