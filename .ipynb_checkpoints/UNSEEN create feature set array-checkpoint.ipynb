    "\n",
    "The intended use of the feature sets is to support clinicians in identifying patients with complex mental health difficulties so that resources can be appropriately delivered. Without information like feature sets, the clinicianâ€™s expected accuracy in identifying patients with complex mental difficulties is 50% - a coin toss. Alternatively, with no other information, one could assume everyone has complex mental health difficulties or no one does. A balance must be struck between these extremes to facilitate optimal and appropriate use of healthcare resources that maximises benefit for the unidentified patients in need. Some boundaries can be defined for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first boundary is that any useful feature set must not be more than 50% prevalent because although a greater prevalence might improve informativeness in the worst-case scenario, it would be at the cost of positive and negative predictive values in any scenario.\n",
    "The second boundary requires some analysis. If the caseness of complex mental health difficulties was a fundamental concept, then any useful feature set must be at least as prevalent as complex mental health difficulties because a lesser prevalence would, at best, disimprove informativeness and negative predictive value with no benefit to positive predictive value. However, the caseness of complex mental health difficulties is a composite of independent component criteria about records of medications and diagnoses. Therefore, the sentiment of the second boundary is better worded as \"any useful feature set must be at least as prevalent _as any of the component criteria_ for the caseness of complex mental health difficulties\".\n",
