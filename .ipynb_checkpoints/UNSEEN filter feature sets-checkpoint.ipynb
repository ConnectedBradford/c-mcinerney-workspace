    "## Calculate the entropy and two-way mutual information of the feature sets and the caseness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our focus is mutual information but I check the entropy of features so that I don't calculate the mutual information for any features whose entropy is less than that of the caseness variable. Justification for this action is based on the fact that the mutual information between the caseness variable and any feature will be less than or equal to the lesser entropy of the caseness or feature, i.e. $I(X_{i};CMHD) ≤ min\\{H(X_{i}), H(CMHD)\\}$. We don’t want any feature set that is worse than no feature set (i.e. having only the caseness prevalence to predict a random outcome value) so we don’t bother with any feature set that will lower the possible mutual information. Two-way mutual information* will not be calculated for those features whose entropy is less than the caseness variable's entropy. The dropped variables are indicated in the `f_to_drop` pandas.DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, two-way mutual information will be calculated between the caseness variable and individual feature sets. Secondly, two-way mutual information will be calculated between the caseness variable and pair-composites of feature sets. These pair composites are individual feature sets that amalgamate two feature sets into a new binary definition, where values are `0` if both component feature sets are zero and `1` otherwise**. More-complicated encoding is possible, e.g. a different level for every combination of values from each component feature set. Further code extends these feature-set compositions up to quintuplet composites (i.e. amalgamating five feature sets into a single binary variable).\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "__\\*__ _Initially, the plan was to use $k$-way mutual information for $k>2$ but the meaning of these mutual information values is controversial at best. I side with [Krippendorf's assessment](https://sci-hub.wf/10.1080/03081070902993160), which renders 3-way mutual information interpretable but not any higher-order mutual information statistics (yet?). I decided to stick with two-way mutual information using composite feature sets so that I am comparing the same statistic across individual and composite feature sets._\n",
    "\n",
    "__\\**__ _Other encodings will be trialled at a later date. If a feature set contains more than one feature, then it will be represented in three ways: OR, AND, and multinomial. The OR representation (alternative called the at-least-one representation) is a binary variable with a value of `0` if the component features are all zero, and `1` otherwise. The AND (alternative called the all-present representation) representation is a binary variable with a value of `1` if all component features are one, and `0` otherwise. The multinomial representation is a multinomial variable with values for each of the possible combinations of component features’ values. For example, given a feature set of two features $A=\\{0,1\\}$ and $B=\\{0,1\\}$, their multinomial feature-set representation would be $C=\\{0,1,2,3\\}$, where $C=0=(A=0\\   AND\\   B=0)$, $C=1=(A=0\\   AND\\   B=1)$, $C=2=(A=1\\  AND\\  B=0)$, and $C=3=(A=1\\   AND\\   B=1)$. The multinomial representation will only be applied to binary variables._"

    "The paradoxes of commonly-reported classification statistics are clearly shown. A medication _review_ has the largest odds ratio but the probability of having a record of the caseness variable given that medication was _requested_ is higher. One might propose that a record of a medication request is a better indicator than a record of a medication review, if they prefer the probability statistic over the odds-ratio statistic. But when we look at the probability of the caseness variable given that there is _no_ record of medication being requested, we see that this is also the largest of the top five feature sets! The odds ratio tries to balance these ambiguous probability statistics but it is, therefore, harder to interpret. Note, the odds ratio for a record of a medication _review_ scores better than for a record of medication _request_ because the distinction between the ambiguous probabilities is greater (multiplicatively).\n",
    "\n",
    "The scaled mutual information is simply a percentage measure of how much the caseness variable is described by the feature set (in terms of information). Unlike the odds ratio, it will give the same value whether the odds are multiplicatively greater or less than equal - e.g. $I_{2}$ will be the same for $OR = 4.0$ and $OR = 0.25$  - so it only measures magnitude of association."
